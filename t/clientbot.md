# Client vs Bot

I often see a lot of people using the wrong one, so here's a guide for which you should use.

### discord.Client

The Client class is made specifically to connect to the gateway and handle API requests. As such it's not suitable for the majority of bot applications, and using commands.Bot is preferable since it will handle command parsing, permssion checks, etc for you.

### discord.ext.commands.Bot

The Bot class is designed specifically for you to create functional bots with. It has far more features than the Client class alone, such as commands, cogs, permissions checks, cooldowns, custom checks you can create, command error handling, and more. Generally speaking you should be using this not client, there are very very few occasions you need to use client.

### Feature Comparison

## A Note About Naming

If you are using discord.Client you should name that variable `client`, likewise, if you are using commands.Bot you should name that variable `bot`. If you stick to naming things like this it will help you and other people understand your code, and make it easier for people to help if something breaks. Good naming matters. Readability counts. Please name your variables correctly, naming a Bot 'client' is akin to creating a variable called `integer` and setting it to a string.

Correct:
```py
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")
```

Incorrect:
```py
client = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")
```
